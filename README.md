Currently a BsC student, hopefully I can be a tech engineer, preferably video games engineer, passionate with customize workspace, clean code and dark theme ðŸŒŒ.
Favorite programming language: C# and Java. Still young, more to come and more to learn!
I wanted to be an astrophysicist or meteorologist but life forced me here, who knows Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯.
